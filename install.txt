Setup A Build Directory
-----------------------
e.g. for your src code at /path/to/pelican-lofar/src

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release /path/to/pelican-lofar/src

You may need to specify where the various dependencies are. This can be done

directory to find the correct variables to set.

If all has gone well CMake will of created you build directory and makefiles.
To build the project you should now type your systems make command such as
make on linux or nmake on windows.

make
